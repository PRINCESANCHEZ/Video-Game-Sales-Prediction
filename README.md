## Overview
This project analyzes video game sales trends by genre and year using machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict future sales and identify key factors influencing success in the gaming industry.

## Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Video Games Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvaingle/video-games-dataset)
- **Description:** Contains data on video game sales across multiple regions, including North America, Europe, Japan, and other global markets.
- **Features Used:**
  - Year of release
  - Genre
  - Global Sales (in millions)

## Project Goals
1. Understand trends in video game sales by genre over the years.
2. Use machine learning models to predict future sales based on past trends.
3. Visualize findings using graphs to highlight key insights.

## Methods
- **Data Cleaning:** Removed unnecessary columns and handled missing values.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Plotted sales trends over time for different genres.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Trained a Linear Regression model for sales prediction.
- **Evaluation:** Used Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to assess model performance.

## Results
- Certain genres (e.g., Action, Shooter) showed a strong increase in sales over time.
- Sales peaked around the late 2000s, with a decline in recent years.
- Predictions suggest steady sales trends for dominant genres in the coming years.
